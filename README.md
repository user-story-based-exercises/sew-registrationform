## User Story 1
*As an admin, I need validation within the registration form, so that I am sure to have validated data from my users.*

### Acceptance Criteria
- A registration form using VueJS is created.
- The following fields are present:
  - Firstname*
  - Lastname*
  - Title (select box showing at least 5 different titles)
  - E-Mail*
  - Birthday*
  - Phonenumber
  - Password*
  - Password repeat (must match the first password field)
- In case of a validation error a meaningful error message is presented to the user.
- The submit button is only clickable, if there are no errors in the registration form.
